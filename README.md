# Permutation playground

## Endpoints
http://localhost:8080/permutation/random/N - generate random permutation of N elements
http://localhost:8080/permutation/P        - show permutation P
http://localhost:8080/permutation/P/N      - shop P^N 

N = number between 1 to n
P = permutation of between 1 to 9 elements written in the form of p(1)p(2)..p(n) (e.g. 312 is a 3-cycle inside S_3 that maps 1 to 3, 2 to 1 and 3 to 2)
